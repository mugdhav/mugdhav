### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! You have found my personal Github page.
I am Mugdha Vairagade, working at the intersection of technology and creativity.

My job is to cut through the jargon and write how to use technology in easy-to-understand language. I also dream up and design stuff.

I use GitHub repositories to house my coding experiments and content samples.

My motto is: simplify, simplify, simplify!
***

You can find some of my ***work samples*** in my [Showcase](https://github.com/mugdhav/showcase) repository available publicly. Fellow professionals, feel free to clone my repository, but take care to not submit the repository's contents as your own work.  
Additionally, I have a **private showcase** repository with **exclusive work samples**, **available on request**. Please message me on LinkedIn for the access.
I am building a viewer-friendly portfolio [website](https://mugdhav.github.io) where you'll be able to take a quick peek into my work samples. 
Follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mugdhav) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vmugdha).
