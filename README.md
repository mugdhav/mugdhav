### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! You have found my home page.
I am Mugdha Vairagade, working at the intersection of technology and content.

My job is to cut through the jargon and explain how to use technology in easy-to-understand language. I also dream up and design stuff.

I use GitHub repositories as the home of my coding experimets and content samples.
