### Hi there 👋! You have found my personal Github page.
I am Mugdha Vairagade, working at the intersection of technology and creativity.

My job is to cut through the jargon and write how to use technology in easy-to-understand language. I also dream up, design, and build stuff with AI help.

My motto is: simplify, simplify, simplify!

I use these GitHub repositories to house my coding experiments and content samples.

***
You can view my latest ***technical writing*** work samples and ***AI development projects*** on my portfolio [website](https://www.vmugdha.in).
Some of my older ***work samples*** are available in my [Showcase](https://github.com/mugdhav/showcase) repository here. Fellow professionals, feel free to clone my repository, but take care to not submit the repository's contents as your own work.  
<!--Additionally, I have a **private showcase** repository with **exclusive work samples**, **available on request**. Please message me on LinkedIn for the access.-->
Follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mugdhav) and [Twitter/X](https://x.com/vmugdha).
