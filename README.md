### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! You have found my home page.
I am Mugdha Vairagade, working at the intersection of technology and creativity.

My job is to cut through the jargon and write how to use technology in easy-to-understand language. I also dream up and design stuff.

I use GitHub repositories to house my coding experiments and content samples.

My motto is: simplify, simplify, simplify!

See some of my work:
